# LMDB

LMDB is a native Perl6 bindings for the OpenLDAP's lmdb (Lightning
Memory-Mapped Database) C library.

lmdb is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value data store developed
by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. See http://symas.com/mdb/ for details.

## PREREQUISITES

Right now lmdb needs a 64bits platform.

Before you can install LMDB you need to have the following installed
on your system:
